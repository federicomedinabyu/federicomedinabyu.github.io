                    Community announcements are important because sometimes we tend to forget important dates. 
                    So we can see on the page what is happening in the community.

                 This year the community has suffered some incidents of insecurity. Photos of suspicious people have been posted on the site
                 so that neighbors are vigilant and thus can prevent theft.
